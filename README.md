<h1 align="center">HopeChain - A decentralized donations platform for disaster management</h1>

## Introduction
HopeChain is a community-driven decentralized donations platform that aims to tackle the world's most intimidating disasters. We have a web as well as a mobile application to enable users to donate funds to on-ground relief organizations. Users may choose to donate to particular relief organizations or a general emergency relief fund. 

Our application focuses on all 4 stages of the disaster cycle - mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. We use blockchain to ensure transparency in the entire process. The basic advantages of using HopeChain over traditional donation platforms are:
  - Faster international transactions
  - Increased Transparency
  - Lower Transaction Costs
  - Increased Security
  
Our Android application lets users do all the things that the web app does, and also lets users upload pictures of potential disasters which are verified by the team. These pictures are uploaded to IPFS to keep them secure and prove their authenticity.

We also reward our donors and with each donation they make, they get some HopeCoins which can be used for purchases with our e-commerce partners.
